Structure Based Drug Design and Struture Based Virtual Screening

Here we are going to use open source software to do all the works. These following works can be done using commercial softwares i.e. Schrodinger suites (Maestro)

Protein Structure Preparation 
    
    Fix common problems
    
        -Tautomer (Molprobity), pH (Propka), protonation (Avogadro, openbabel, AutoDock)
        
        - Missing side chains (SwissPDB Viewer)
        
        - Missing Loops (SwissPDB Viewer)
    
    Remove unwanted molecules
    
        - Counterions, artifacts, of crystallography, waters
    
    Optimize your Strcuture
    
        - Hydrogen-bond Otimization
        
        - Remove water
        
        - Restrained minimization
